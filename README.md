# GrooveLab

This is project is entirely made with the Meta SDK. It pushed the boundaries of Meta's SDK, diving deep into functionalities like Passthrough, hand tracking, pre-made scripts, ray interactions, poke interactions, controller input, buttons and curved UIs. It's not just a drum app; it's a showcase of Meta's potential for intuitive MR interactions and immersive design. Every tap, poke, and swipe feels intuitive, creating a drum kit so believable you'll forget it's virtual.
